# 🗳 Governance – Wikimint Ecosystem

Wikimint is moving toward a decentralized governance model powered by the WMT token. Token holders will help guide platform decisions through proposals and voting.

---

## 🧠 Governance Goals

- Align decision-making with community values
- Empower long-term holders and contributors
- Increase transparency and decentralization

---

## 🧱 Voting System (Planned)

- **Token-weighted voting:** 1 WMT = 1 vote
- **On-chain proposals:** Anyone can propose if they hold X WMT
- **Snapshot-based voting:** Uses token balance at proposal time

---

## ⚖️ Proposal Categories

- Platform features and upgrades
- Allocation of development funds
- Partner and ecosystem integrations
- DAO treasury management

---

## 🔐 Security

Voting and execution will use audited smart contracts to prevent abuse or manipulation. Multi-signature wallets will manage sensitive operations in early phases.

---

## ⏳ Timeline

| Stage            | Timeline      |
|------------------|---------------|
| Proposal Drafting | Q3 2024       |
| Community DAO Launch | Q4 2024       |
