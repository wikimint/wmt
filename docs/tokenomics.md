## Third-Party Scanner Warning Explanation

Some token scanners (such as GoPlus) may show the following **false warnings**:

- **"Mint Function Detected"**:  
  → This is due to the presence of a `mint()` function in the code. However, **ownership has been renounced**, and minting is permanently disabled.

- **"Functions That Can Suspend Trading"**:  
  → The contract includes standard ERC20/Pausable logic, but **these functions are now inaccessible** due to the renounced ownership. Trading cannot be paused or blacklisted.

These warnings are **non-applicable** and **pose no real risk** to holders.

## Final Notes

- The WMT token is **fully decentralized**, and no central entity has any control over token supply or trading behavior.
- These precautions ensure long-term stability and trust for holders and DEX platforms.
- We welcome any manual review by platforms or auditors — our contract is open-source and verified.
